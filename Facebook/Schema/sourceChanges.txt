1. change @event to facebookevent
2.  Add these using statements
    using System.Xml;
    using System.Xml.Linq;
2. In fql_result, update to look like.  public partial class fql_result
	{

		private string nameField;

		private XElement fql_result_setField;

		public string name
		{
			get
			{
				return this.nameField;
			}
			set
			{
				this.nameField = value;
			}
		}

		[XmlAnyElement]
		public XElement fql_result_set
		{
			get
			{
				return this.fql_result_setField;
			}
			set
			{
				this.fql_result_setField = value;
			}
		}

	}
3. For any property that has an associated "Specified" property, change the property and its underlying private data member to be nullable.
   For example, user has a uid property (long) and a uidSpecified property. In this case, you would change the type of uid and uidField both to long?.
   Note that you can probably ignore this for the list property that shows up on many classes, since it shouldn't be used anywhere.
