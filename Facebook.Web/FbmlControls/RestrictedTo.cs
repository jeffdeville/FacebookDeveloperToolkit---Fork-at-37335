Also, if the user hides their age for privacy reasons, Facebook cannot determine whether or not the content is visible to the user, and thus it cannot be displayed. In this case, your fb:else clause should contain content that any user who doesn't necessarily meet these restrictions could see.

You can use plus (+) and minus (-) to restrict content to that age or older/younger (like 21+ for 21 and older or 18- for younger than 19). You can also specify a range of ages, like 18-35 so anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 (inclusive) can see the content. You can also specify multiple age ranges (like 19-,30+ -- if you want to exclude people in their 20s, for example). Every specified age must be an integer, and only the integer part of a user's age is taken into account. So for example, a user who is 17.9 years old will be treated as 17, and "18-35" includes anyone 18 or older but under 36.
